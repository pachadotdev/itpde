Description: Provides consistent data on international and domestic trade for 243 countries, 170 industries, and 17 years.
    The data are constructed at the industry level covering agriculture, mining, energy, manufacturing, and services for
    the period 1986-2019. The ITPD-E is constructed using reported administrative data and intentionally does not include
    information estimated by statistical techniques, which makes the ITPD-E well suited for estimation of economic models,
    such as the gravity model of trade.
