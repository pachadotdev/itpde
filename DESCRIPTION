Description: Provides consistent data on international and domestic trade for 
    243 countries, 170 industries, and 17 years alongside variables for gravity
    estimation. The data sources are ITPD-E and DGD from the USITC, which use 
    administrative data and intentionally does not include information estimated
    by statistical techniques, which makes the datasets suitable for gravity 
    estimation.
